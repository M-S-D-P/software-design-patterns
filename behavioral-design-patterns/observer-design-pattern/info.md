# Observer design pattern
The Observer design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object (subject) to notify other objects (observers) about changes in its state. This pattern is useful when you want to maintain consistency between related objects without tightly coupling them.

Let's say you're waiting for an important email from the manager. Once you receive it, you’ll have to immediately make the required changes to the codebase. You could send them an email that says “Are you going to send it right now?” every 5 minutes. But they might and probably will be annoyed by it. The more natural way is to go on with your life and once they send the email, you'll have a notification and you can start working right away. This is what is called the observer pattern.
