# Strategy Design Pattern

The Strategy design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as an object, and make them interchangeable. This pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

When you buy a pencil you usually don't care what brand it is as long as itâ€™s working and it's not expensive. This means that they are interchangeable for you and when you go to the market, you look for a pencil, not a particular brand. This is the strategy pattern.
