# Prototype design pattern

The Prototype design pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype, rather than creating new instances from scratch. This pattern is useful when the construction of a new object is more efficient by copying an existing object, especially when the initialization process is complex or resource-intensive.

This pattern resolves the following problems:

* Complex object creation: When creating an object involves complex initialization logic or resource-intensive operations, the Prototype pattern allows us to create new instances by copying an existing object, avoiding the need to repeat the initialization process.
* Avoiding subclassing: Instead of creating subclasses for each variation of an object, the Prototype pattern allows us to create prototype instances and clone them to create new variations, reducing the need for subclassing and inheritance hierarchies.

Overall, the Prototype pattern promotes flexibility and reusability by enabling the creation of new objects through cloning existing instances.
