# Prototype design pattern

The Prototype design pattern is a creational pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype, rather than creating new instances from scratch. This pattern is useful when the construction of a new object is more efficient by copying an existing object, especially when the initialization process is complex or resource-intensive.
