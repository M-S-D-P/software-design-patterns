# Factory Design Pattern

The Factory design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating instances of a class, with its subclasses deciding which class to instantiate. This pattern is useful when we want to delegate the responsibility of instantiating objects to its subclasses.

This pattern resolves the following problems:

* Complex object creation: When creating an object involves complex initialization logic or resource-intensive operations, the Prototype pattern allows us to create new instances by copying an existing object, avoiding the need to repeat the initialization process.
* Avoiding subclassing: Instead of creating subclasses for each variation of an object, the Prototype pattern allows us to create prototype instances and clone them to create new variations, reducing the need for subclassing and inheritance hierarchies.

Overall, the Prototype pattern promotes flexibility and reusability by enabling the creation of new objects through cloning existing instances.
