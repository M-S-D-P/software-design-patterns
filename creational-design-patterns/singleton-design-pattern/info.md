# Singleton Factory Pattern

The Singleton Factory pattern combines the Singleton pattern and the Factory pattern to ensure that only one instance of a factory is created and used throughout the application. This pattern is useful when you want to ensure that all requests for object creation go through a single point, while also ensuring that only one instance of the factory exists.
