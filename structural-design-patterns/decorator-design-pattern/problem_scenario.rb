# Imagine you're developing a text editor application. You have a TextComponent class that represents basic text functionality. However, you want to enhance the functionality of certain text components, such as adding borders, scrollbars, or different text styles, without modifying the original class.

# Example:

# Let's define the scenario with a simplified example:
# TextComponent class representing basic text functionality

class TextComponent
  def render
    "Basic text component"
  end
end
# Now, let's say we want to enhance this TextComponent with additional features
# such as borders, scrollbars, and different text styles using the Decorator pattern.
