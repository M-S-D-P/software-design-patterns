# Proxy design pattern
The Proxy design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It is commonly used to add a level of indirection to support distributed, controlled, or lazy access to the real object. In Ruby, you can implement the Proxy pattern using classes that mimic the interface of the real object and delegate the actual work to it when needed.
