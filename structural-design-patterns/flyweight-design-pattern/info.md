# Flyweight design pattern

The Flyweight design pattern is a structural pattern that aims to minimize memory usage and improve performance by sharing common state between multiple objects. It's particularly useful when dealing with a large number of similar objects that can be divided into intrinsic (shared) and extrinsic (context-dependent) state.
