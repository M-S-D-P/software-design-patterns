# Software design patterns

A comphrensive gist of different software design patterns with examples


## Creational Patterns
### Factory Method
Defines an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
### Abstract Factory
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
### Singleton
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
### Builder
Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
### Prototype
Creates objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype, during runtime.

## Structural Patterns
### Adapter
Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a middle layer to translate requests.
### Bridge
Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently.
### Composite
Lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
### Decorator
Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing.
### Facade
Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, simplifying the use of complex systems.
### Flyweight
Uses sharing to support large numbers of similar objects efficiently.
### Proxy
Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## Behavioral Patterns
### Observer
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
### Strategy
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.
### Command
Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queueing of requests, and support for undoable operations.
### Chain of Responsibility
Passes a request along a chain of handlers, each handling the request or forwarding it to the next handler in the chain.
### State
Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
### Iterator
Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying representation.
### Mediator
Reduces dependencies between classes by centralizing complex communication and control between objects.
### Memento
Captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that it can be restored to this state later.
### Template Method
Defines the structure of an algorithm but allows its steps to be implemented by individual subclasses.
### Visitor
Separates an algorithm from the object structure on which it operates, allowing adding new operations without modifying the structures.
